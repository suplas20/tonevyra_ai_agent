# CLI Operations - CLI 운영

> Agent-readable design document. Follow these instructions exactly when implementing.

## Global MVP Decisions

- Model input: `1024px sRGB JPEG preview + EXIF/basic metadata`.
- Deferred: `2048px high-quality preview`, `subject crop`, `multi-view input`, `Lightroom neutral preview`, and default high-capacity Qwen2.5-VL-7B/Qwen3-VL-8B before benchmark.
- Commercial default model: `Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct 4bit/GGUF`.
- Main DB: `PostgreSQL`.
- Detailed outputs: local `Artifact Storage`.
- Debug traces: file logs only.

## 1. Commands

init, doctor, start, status, scan, test-lightroom, test-vision, retry, list.

## 2. No Business Logic

CLI must call services; do not implement core workflow inside CLI command handlers.

## 3. Doctor

Check DB, artifacts, folders, bridge, plugin ping, model backend.

## 4. Mock

Support mock vision backend for development.

## 5. Retry

Explicit retry only; record events and retry_history artifact.

## Implementation Guardrails

- Do not build the full React dashboard before the agent core is stable.
- Do not replace PostgreSQL with SQLite.
- Do not store image binaries in PostgreSQL.
- Do not store heavy raw model payloads in PostgreSQL unless explicitly requested.
- Do not make high-quality preview or 7B model mandatory in MVP.
- Do not let the model directly edit images or bypass Correction Planner.
- Do not skip artifact persistence or crash recovery.

<!-- LOOP_ENGINEERING_UPDATE_V3 -->

## CLI Commands for Loop Engineering and Learning

CLI must expose loop visibility without requiring a dashboard.

Recommended additions:

```bash
mw-agent loop-status
mw-agent loop-events TASK_ID
mw-agent feedback sync TASK_ID
mw-agent feedback approve TASK_ID
mw-agent feedback reject TASK_ID --reason too_blue
mw-agent benchmark-models --sample-set harness
```

CLI must not contain loop business logic. It calls clean interfaces in agent, recovery, lightroom, learning, benchmark, and db modules.

## Commercial Model Policy Update - Qwen3 Default

Tonevyra AI uses a commercial-safe local model policy.

```text
Commercial default vision model candidate:
Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct 4bit/GGUF

Commercial quality candidate:
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 4bit, hardware permitting

Research/non-commercial reference only:
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct 4bit
```

Rules:

```text
- Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct 4bit/GGUF is the commercial default candidate, subject to local benchmark validation.
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 4bit may be evaluated as a quality candidate when hardware allows.
- Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct must not be used as the commercial default unless a separate commercial license is obtained.
- All model inference must remain local-only and offline-capable.
- The model may receive only 1024px sRGB JPEG preview + EXIF/basic metadata.
- The model must not receive original RAW files, Lightroom catalog files, private DB dumps, unrelated user files, or external URLs.
- Model loading must use local files only, no runtime downloads, no remote API fallback, and no `trust_remote_code=True`.
```

## Model License Verification Rule

Before real model deployment or public/commercial distribution, the agent or developer must re-check the live model card and license file for the selected model and record:

```text
model_id
model_version_or_revision
local_path
license
sha256 or verified file hash
commercial_allowed flag
verification_date
```

Do not assume that a model license remains unchanged across revisions.
